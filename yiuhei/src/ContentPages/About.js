          <p>I don&rsquo;t really know where to begin.&nbsp;<br />I can tell every story but mine.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s stick to the facts:</strong>&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a graduate from an architecture school with an interest in detailed small scale work and an unhealthy dose of romanticism.&nbsp; All this has led me to pursue stories through design and objects.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>It always begins with questions:</strong> what&rsquo;s the context?&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s involved?&nbsp; What is it made of?&nbsp; How will you interact with it?&nbsp; How will it wear in five, ten, fifteen years?&nbsp;</p>
<p>With answers to those questions we form a narrative.&nbsp; With narrative, we begin design.&nbsp; At least&hellip; that&rsquo;s how I think it should be.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The product of all this:</strong> a collection of garments and accessories to clothe characters in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the adventure as much as I did, and do.</p>
<p>With Love,<br />Yiu Hei Cheung<br />Toronto, Ontario, Canada&nbsp;</p>
